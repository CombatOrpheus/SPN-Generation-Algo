%% result_struct = get_reachability_graph(petri_matrix, place_upper_limit, marks_upper_limit)
%%
%% Computes the reachability graph of a Stochastic Petri Net (SPN).
%%
%% A reachability graph is a directed graph that represents all possible states
%% (markings) that a Petri net can reach from its initial marking by firing
%% sequences of transitions. Each node (vertex) in the graph is a unique marking,
%% and each directed edge represents a transition firing that leads from one
%% marking to another.
%%
%% This function performs a breadth-first search of the state space, starting
%% from the initial marking M0. It systematically explores new markings by firing
%% all enabled transitions from the current set of known markings. To prevent
%% infinite exploration of unbounded nets, the function includes checks to limit
%% the maximum number of tokens per place and the total number of markings explored.
%%
%% Inputs:
%%   petri_matrix: The compound matrix representing the SPN. This is a
%%                 pn x (2*tn + 1) matrix with the structure:
%%                 [T_in, T_out, M0], where T_in is the pre-incidence matrix,
%%                 T_out is the post-incidence matrix, and M0 is the initial marking.
%%
%%   place_upper_limit: (Optional) The maximum number of tokens allowed in any
%%                      single place. If any explored marking exceeds this limit,
%%                      the exploration stops, and the net is flagged as unbounded.
%%                      Default: 10.
%%
%%   marks_upper_limit: (Optional) The maximum number of unique markings to explore.
%%                      If the number of discovered markings exceeds this limit,
%%                      the exploration stops, and the net is flagged as unbounded.
%%                      Default: 500.
%%
%% Outputs:
%%   result_struct: A structure containing the results of the graph computation.
%%     .v_list: A matrix where each column represents a unique marking (vertex)
%%              found during the exploration. The number of rows equals the
%%              number of places in the net.
%%     .edge_list: An m x 2 matrix representing the directed edges of the graph,
%%                 where m is the total number of state transitions found. Each
%%                 row is a [source_marking_idx, dest_marking_idx] pair, where the
%%                 indices correspond to columns in `v_list`.
%%     .arctrans_list: A column vector of length m, where each element is the
%%                     index of the transition that fired to create the
%%                     corresponding edge in `edge_list`.
%%     .bounded: A boolean flag. It is `true` if the exploration completed without
%%               exceeding the specified limits, and `false` otherwise.
